    <h1>Source Control's Project!</h1>
    <p>Our team plans to develop a campus-focused eCommerce web application inspired by platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace, but designed specifically for CCNY students. The platform will provide a secure, student-only marketplace where users can buy, sell, and exchange goods such as textbooks, electronics, dorm essentials, and other items within the CCNY community. By limiting access to verified CCNY students, the application reduces competition from broader marketplaces while ensuring a trusted environment where exchanges can safely take place on campus. This project aims to make student life more affordable, convenient, and connected by fostering a reliable marketplace tailored to the needs of the CCNY community.</p>
